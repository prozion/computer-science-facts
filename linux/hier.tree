/ d:"This is the root directory. This is where the whole tree starts"
	bin d:"This directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or repair it"
	boot d:"Contains static files for the boot loader. This directory holds only the files which are needed during the boot process.  The map installer and configuration files should go to /sbin and /etc.  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either / or /boot"
	efi d:"If the boot partition /boot/ is maintained separately from the EFI System Partition (ESP), the latter is mounted here. Tools that need to operate on the EFI system partition should look for it at this mount point first, and fall back to /boot/ â€” if the former doesn't qualify (for example if it is not a mount point or does not have the correct file system type MSDOS_SUPER_MAGIC)"
	dev d:"Special or device files, which refer to physical devices" see:`man 1 mknod`
		shm d:"Place for POSIX shared memory segments, as created via shm_open(3). This directory is flushed on boot, and is a 'tmpfs' file system. Since all users have write access to this directory, special care should be taken to avoid name clashes and vulnerabilities. For normal users, shared memory segments in this directory are usually deleted when the user logs out. Usually, it is a better idea to use memory mapped files in /run/ (for system programs) or $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (for user programs) instead of POSIX shared memory segments, since these directories are not world-writable and hence not vulnerable to security-sensitive name clashes"
	etc d:"Contains configuration files which are local to the machine. Some larger software packages, like X11, can have their own subdirectories below /etc. Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or in /usr/etc. Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in /etc and you may have links for these files to /usr/etc"

	home d:"The location for normal user's home directories. Possibly shared with other systems, and never read-only. This directory should only be used for normal users, never for system users. This directory and possibly the directories contained within it might only become available or writable in late boot or even only after user authentication. This directory might be placed on limited-functionality network file systems, hence applications should not assume the full set of file API is available on this directory. Applications should generally not reference this directory directly, but via the per-user $HOME environment variable, or via the home directory field of the user database"
		.cache d:"Persistent user cache data. User programs may place non-essential data in this directory. Flushing this directory should have no effect on operation of programs, except for increased runtimes necessary to rebuild these caches. If an application finds $XDG_CACHE_HOME set, it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory"
		.config d:"Application configuration and state. When a new user is created, this directory will be empty or not exist at all. Applications should fall back to defaults should their configuration or state in this directory be missing. If an application finds $XDG_CONFIG_HOME set, it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory"
		.local
			bin d:"Executables that shall appear in the user's $PATH search path. It is recommended not to place executables in this directory that are not useful for invocation from a shell; these should be placed in a subdirectory of ~/.local/lib/ instead. Care should be taken when placing architecture-dependent binaries in this place, which might be problematic if the home directory is shared between multiple hosts with different architectures"

				<arch-id> d:"Location for placing public dynamic libraries. The architecture identifier to use is defined on Multiarch Architecture Specifiers (Tuples) list"
			share d:"Resources shared between multiple packages, such as fonts or artwork. Usually, the precise location and format of files stored below this directory is subject to specifications that ensure interoperability. If an application finds $XDG_DATA_HOME set, it should use the directory specified in it instead of this directory"

		modules d:"Loadable kernel modules" optional:<t>
	lib64 d:"On some architecture ABIs, this compatibility symlink points to $libdir, ensuring that binaries referencing this legacy path correctly find their dynamic loader. This symlink only exists on architectures whose ABI places the dynamic loader in this path"
	lost+found d:"This directory contains items lost in the filesystem. These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a consequence of a faulty disk or a system crash"
	media d:"This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.  On systems where more than one device exists for mounting a certain type of media, mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of those available above starting with '0', but the unqualified name must also exist"

	proc d:"This is a mount point for the proc filesystem, which provides information about running processes and the kernel" see:`man 3 proc`
		sys d:"A hierarchy below /proc/ that exposes a number of kernel tunables. The primary way to configure the settings in this API file tree is via sysctl.d(5) files. In sandboxed/containerized setups, this directory is generally mounted read-only"

	run d:"A 'tmpfs' file system for system packages to place runtime data in. This directory is flushed on boot, and generally writable for privileged programs only. Always writable"
		log d:"Runtime system logs. System components may place private logs in this directory. Always writable, even when /var/log/ might not be accessible yet"
		user d:"Contains per-user runtime directories, each usually individually mounted 'tmpfs' instances. Always writable, flushed at each reboot and when the user logs out. User code should not reference this directory directly, but via the $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable, as documented in the XDG Base Directory Specification"
	sbin d:"Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually not executed by normal users"
	srv d:"The place to store general server payload, managed by the administrator. No restrictions are made how this directory is organized internally. Generally writable, and possibly shared among systems. This directory might become available or writable only very late during boot"
	sys d:"This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel like /proc, but better structured, following the formalism of kobject infrastructure"
	tmp d:"This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at system boot up. This directory is usually mounted as a 'tmpfs' instance, and should hence not be used for larger files. (Use /var/tmp/ for larger files.) This directory is usually flushed at boot-up. Also, files that are not accessed within a certain time may be automatically deleted."
	usr d:"This directory is usually mounted from a separate partition.  It should hold only shareable, read-only data, so that it can be mounted by various machines running Linux"
